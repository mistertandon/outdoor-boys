## Camping Under the Snow in Survival Shelter - Part 02 | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnrqkMpfj8)

It’s **starting to get cold**, so I think I need to **put on my down jacket**.
*I have to say, it feels luxurious to have a shelter where I can actually stand upright.*

If I had pitched this **tarp** directly on the ground, as I usually do, I’d be **kneeling in the snow and ice**, and that would just **drain the heat** right out of me. Not to mention, it would make it *really difficult to change clothes comfortably.*

I’ve got to tell you — I **love these Exped sleeping mats** for winter camping. They’re **incredibly warm** and come with a **pump sack** that makes inflation easy. That’s a **common feature** among most **premium camping brands** here in the U.S.

There we go — plenty of space! *I don’t have to worry about rolling off the edge or pressing against the icy wall in the middle of the night.* This setup will work perfectly.

This is an **emergency bivvy**, useful if you get caught in a **snowstorm** and need quick shelter. It also serves as an excellent **protective layer** for your **sleeping mat or sleeping bag** when staying in a **shelter** rather than a **tent**.

Last trip, I had a lot of trouble with my **stove**, so I cleaned it thoroughly this time — and it seems to be working great now.
Sleeping bags take a while to **loft up** in the cold, so I always give them some time.

Wow, that water **boiled quickly!**
All right — I’ve got **boil-in-bag rice**, and these **Japanese curry packs** just need to be warmed up. *Hot curry sounds absolutely amazing right now!*

All the **steam** from the hot food and water is starting to **fill my shelter**, and I can feel a **temperature difference** — my **head is warm**, but my **feet are getting cold**, as all the warm air **rises to the top**.

You really have to **eat fast in winter** — *your food gets cold in no time.*
It’s crazy that an entire pack of curry and rice still has **fewer calories** than that one **fry pie** I had earlier.

Man, that hit the spot!
Now, I think I’ll make some **dessert**. Check this out — **bread pudding!**
I mixed all the **ingredients raw** into a bag, **vacuum-sealed** it, **froze** it, and now I just **boil it for 15–20 minutes**. It cooks right inside the bag, ready to eat.

There we go — **dishes done.**
My little **cooking table** is a bit **unstable**, but I’m so grateful not to be **cooking on the ground**. I avoid it because it’s **hard on my back and knees**, and the **cold from the snow** seeps right through.

There’s at least a **10°C temperature difference** between standing up here and kneeling down there.
The temperature’s **dropping fast**, so I’m going to use some **body warmers** — these things are **magical!**
They last for **about 12 hours** and come with **adhesive backs**. *I place one on my chest and another on my lower back — and they really work.*

I wish I had some **vanilla ice cream** to go with my bread pudding… oh wait, I can make some!
All I need is **sweetened condensed milk**, **vanilla extract**, and **fresh fluffy snow**.
There we go — a little cup of **homemade vanilla ice cream**.

Oh yeah, that looks perfect — **bread pudding and vanilla ice cream!**

If you’ve never tried **bread pudding**, it’s basically **French toast in dessert form**.
You mix **eggs, cream, sugar, vanilla, raisins, and cinnamon**, pour it over **chunks of bread**, then **bake or steam it**. *It tastes amazing with vanilla ice cream!*

You can use the same method for **cake batter**, **brownies**, or **other desserts** too.

Wow, that was delicious!
The **snow ice cream** turned out great — *definitely something fun to try at home on a snow day.*

Now I’ve got some **powdered Tang**. *Hot Tang on a winter campout — that’s pure nostalgia.* That’s what we used to drink as kids.

All right, let’s not waste this **hot water** — I’m going to **pour it into my sleeping bag** to pre-warm it.

*I really love that I can stand up inside this shelter — it makes a huge difference.*

Got my **puffy pants** and **down slippers** on — time to **hop into bed**.
It’s nice having an **elevated sleeping platform**.

Well, I’ll tell you what — *this is cozy.*
I’m **warm and comfortable**, and even though it’s still cold inside, it’s **much warmer than other snow shelters** I’ve slept in.

I don’t know if the camera can catch it, but it’s **snowing heavily outside** — I can hear it **hitting the roof**.
The snow isn’t **sloughing off** the shelter as I’d like, and it’s starting to **pile up**, which could **add a lot of weight**.
If too much builds up, it might **collapse the tent**, and *that’s the last thing I want happening in the middle of the night.*

So, while I’m **listening to my audiobook**, I’ll keep an eye on it.
Whoa, that’s a lot of snow up there — it’s **2:00 a.m.**, and it’s still coming down hard.
So far, I’ve had to **clear the tarp every two hours**.

All right, **good night**.

**Good morning!**
The **snow has stopped**, but it’s still **freezing cold**.
Luckily, my **sleeping bag is warm**, and I’m staying in here as long as possible — *I don’t want to get out just yet.*

Ah, my **back!**
Putting on **frozen boots** is always a joy. Fortunately, they weren’t too wet last night, so they **didn’t freeze solid** and are **warming up quickly**.
