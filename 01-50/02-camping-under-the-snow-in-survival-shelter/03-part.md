## Camping Under the Snow in Survival Shelter - Part 03 | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnrqkMpfj8)

Oh, my **gloves**—they’re completely **frozen!**
There they are. The gloves were a little wet last night, so I put them at the **bottom of my sleeping bag**, and they’ve **dried up nicely**.

The **stove** really **warmed things up** in here; you can see the **frost has melted** on the inside of the **tent walls**.
*My feet are still cold, but the upper half of my body feels warm.*

Oh, my **glasses are all fogged up**—ah, there we go. Now I’m nice and **toasty warm.**

---

For **breakfast**, we’re having one of my **favorite meals** — **biscuits and gravy.**
Got a rich **sausage gravy** here; just going to **heat it up**.
I’ll let it **simmer** for a few minutes — there we go.

I always **warm my plate first**, so it doesn’t **cool the food down**.
*I absolutely love biscuits and gravy.*

It’s one of the **simplest yet most satisfying meals** — **heavy whipping cream**, **pork sausage**, and **lots of pepper.**
It’s a **traditional Southern U.S. breakfast**, hearty and full of flavor.

---

*I’ve got to say, this shelter has performed better than expected.*
For the **size of the tarp**, I’m getting **a surprising amount of space**, and when the **stove’s burning**, it’s actually **quite warm** — at least **from the waist up.**

I’ve got **storage room** for my gear and an **elevated bed platform**.
The only drawback is that this **tarp shelter** can’t handle **heavy snow loads**.

If it started snowing hard — say, **six inches an hour** — I’d need to **clear it off every 10 to 15 minutes**.
Once the snowpack deepens, though, I can **dig a proper snow cave**, and *then I don’t have to worry about snow accumulation at all.*

---

Oh, this is **beautiful** — absolutely **gorgeous scenery.**
I think I’m going to go **skiing** for a while.

Stepping outside now — we’ve got a layer of **ice fog**, but I think it’ll **burn off soon.**
*We’re going to have a stunning day ahead.*

I’m skiing in my **pulk tracks**, and it’s like the **perfectly groomed trail** — smooth, compact, and fast.
I feel **so light and nimble!**

The **sun’s starting to dip**, but I’m not far from the **summit.**
Made it just in time — *the view is breathtaking!*

---

Take a look here — on the **bottom of my skis**, I’ve got **synthetic climbing skins**, which work like **seal skin**.
They let me **glide forward smoothly** while also **providing traction uphill.**

Now that I’m heading downhill, I’ll **peel them off**, **roll them up**, and **keep them in my pocket** to prevent the **adhesive from freezing.**

There we go — now they’re **downhill skis** again.

*Okay, promise you won’t laugh — I’ve only been downhill skiing once in the last twenty years, so I’m a bit rusty.*
But if you’re going to fail, what a **beautiful day** to do it!

Let’s make it even harder — I’ll do it **one-handed** while holding the camera!

So far, so good.
Ah, it’s slowly coming back to me.
Whoa — just a little uphill section to push through.

*I’m starting to get the hang of it again.*
I think I’ve finally **shaken off the rust.**

That’s it — time to **switch back to my climbing skins** and return to **cross-country mode.**

---

It took me about **two hours to ascend the mountain**, and only **twenty minutes to ski down**, but I’ve definitely **found my rhythm again.**

I have to say, it’s much **more enjoyable** skiing **without pulling the pulk** full of gear.
