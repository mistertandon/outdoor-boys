## Camping Under the Snow in Survival Shelter - Part 01 | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnrqkMpfj8)

**Luke here from the *Outdoor Boy* YouTube channel!**
It’s **wintertime in the Alaskan mountains**, and I’m going **deep-snow camping**. *I’ll be building my own shelter, cooking hearty meals, exploring the mountains with snowshoes and skis — and taking you all along for the adventure!*

I think **this spot looks perfect**.
This **sled** here is called a **pulk** — a type of sled designed for hauling gear over snow.
A couple of weeks ago, I was having **a lot of trouble** with it flipping over, but I think I’ve finally solved that problem.

I went ahead and **attached a second sled**, bolting them together at the **mounting brackets**. *Now, even if it flips, it doesn’t matter anymore.*

Additionally, I’ve placed all my **heavy equipment** inside the pulk and packed my **light, bulky items** — like my sleeping bag — in my backpack.
This setup helps **keep the center of gravity low**, making the sled more stable.
These two adjustments have made a **significant improvement** — I haven’t had any issues today.

The snow looks to be about **180 cm (around 6 feet) deep** here.

Oh, I’m starting to get hungry — time for a **quick snack break**!
I’m going to treat myself to a **cherry fry pie**. *Oh, these are so good!*

All right, I put my **snow saw** down somewhere around here, but I can’t seem to find it. Where did that thing go?
Let me check my footage to see where I set it down.
Ah, there it is — *that was so random!*

You can actually **see light filtering through the snow** here.
That means there’s **less than two feet of snow left above me**, so I’m getting close to the surface.

---

All right, I’ve got the **tarp shelter** up just in time — the snowfall is really starting to pick up.
But I still need to **seal the edges** properly.
It’s almost **4:00 p.m.**, and it’s getting dark fast.

I can’t leave anything on the ground — it’ll just get buried overnight.

So right here, this is going to be **my bed for the night**, though it’s not perfectly flat yet.
I’d also like to **push the snow wall back a little** so I’m not pressed right against the ice.

I’ve filled up my sled with snow, and now I need to haul it out.
That’s looking pretty good!

Next, I’m going to use my **snow probe** to measure the bed and make sure it’s long enough.
It looks to be about **8 feet long**, which is the **minimum I can manage** — I’m a tall guy, after all.

I also want a few inches of **air insulation** between my sleeping bag and the **ice walls**.
*If the sleeping bag touches the ice during the night, it’ll freeze instantly — and I definitely don’t want that.*
