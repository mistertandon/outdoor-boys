I’ve seen some sketchy bridges in my time, but this one takes the cake. I’m not sure I even want to be on it. I’ll die someday, but it’s not going to be today—not on that bridge.

Look, otter footprints—there’s its tail mark too. A lot happening here. Oh wait—look at this! Mommy’s going to be so happy; there are shells everywhere. That one’s perfect—not broken at all.

And over there—I can see about eleven sea otters floating on their backs. They love eating butter clams.

This weather turned out beautiful. We need to gather plenty of firewood since we’ll be here for three days. A big fire will keep us warm.

There’s a seal—its head’s poking out of the water, watching us. Looks curious.

Hey Jake, you hungry? I think you’re going to have the lasagna with meat sauce. I’ll do the spicy gumbo. I’ve mixed bread flour and yeast, so I’ll bake some bread. Got it? Perfect.

The tide’s starting to go down; we’ll have another low tide in a couple of hours. Let’s cook this clam—really easy to shell. I’ll season it with a little pepper, roll it in pancake batter, and fry it in oil. There we go—delicious. I could definitely eat more of those.

Jake, how’s your lasagna? Good? I’ll have fresh bread with my gumbo. Honestly, dehydrated meals taste a lot better with bread. Makes all the difference.

Dinner’s done, now we need more water. You ready, Jake? Wow—you’re so fast. I’m out of breath. Want some chocolate milk? Good stuff, isn’t it? Double thumbs up! Careful with that knife.

Here, let me show you a special s’more. Take a marshmallow, make a little hole, fill it with Hershey’s chocolate sauce, then roast it. Look at that—amazing.

The tide’s receding, so Jake and I are going to explore a bit more. Look—there’s a perfect razor clam dimple. If you dig straight down, you’ll break them, so dig beside it. There he is—a small one, but we got him. Good job, Jake! Want to dig the next one?

Hold on—look at that! Two clams right next to each other. That was easy. Whoa—did you see that one squirt at you? Tried to spray you! This one’s a big one.

We’ve collected a bunch of razor clams, though most are small. Tomorrow’s a big negative tide, so we’ll search for a better clamming spot in the morning.

Alright Jake, time for bed—we’ve got an early start. You’re all tucked in. I’ll clean up camp while you sleep. Everything’s packed, Jacob’s out, so I’ll get some rest too. See you bright and early tomorrow.

Morning, Jake—this is a really low tide. We might find some big clams. Ready?

I brought a clam gun—it pulls clams right out of the mud. See that dimple? Cover the hole, and—whoa—there he is! That’s a proper-sized razor clam. Nice catch.

Look at this one, Jake—that’s a big one.
