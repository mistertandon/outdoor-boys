Luke and Jake here with the Outdoor Boys YouTube channel. We’re stranded on the Alaskan Peninsula, spending the next three days camping, avoiding bears, foraging for food, and exploring abandoned villages. The only way home is by bush plane. Hopefully, we can make it through the night.

Let’s get our gear together—we’ve got some hiking to do.

Welcome to Polly Creek, Alaska. Polly Creek is located on the northeast side of the Alaskan Peninsula, which has the highest concentration of brown bears in North America. Tourists travel from around the world to see them, but unlike them, our goal is to avoid any bear encounters. Hopefully, that goes smoothly.

Look at the size of this wolf—absolutely massive. Its stride is incredible. Luckily, there are no bear prints here. Come on, Jake, let’s explore a bit.

This looks like a piece of jade—people could make jewelry from it. And here’s pumice; we’re close to Mount Redoubt and Mount Spurr, two of Alaska’s more active volcanoes. When I was a kid, Mount Spurr erupted and covered our house in several inches of volcanic ash.

Here’s a small stream—it’s a little brackish. Look at this, a razor clam shell. They’re large, edible clams and quite common here. With these mudflats, we might find some, but Alaska’s tides rise 20 to 30 feet, and there’s also quicksand. That combination can be dangerous.

Oh—here’s a ragworm. These little piles of sand are from them. They make excellent bait for ocean fishing. And here’s the shell of a butter clam, another edible species. These mussels attach to rocks—they’re edible too, though these are small, so we’ll leave them.

Low tide was a few hours ago, and the tide is already rushing back. We can’t stay on the mudflats long. Here’s another edible clam—cockles. I’d love to gather some. The shells scattered around show we’re in the right spot. Look—this dimple in the sand means a clam is hiding below. And here’s a baby razor clam. Want to keep him for dinner, Jake? Alright, but he’s your responsibility.

The tide’s coming in fast. Look, Jake—the water here rose a foot in just 10 minutes. We’d better leave. Well, we found a good clamming spot for tomorrow, just in time.

Let’s set up our tent. We’ll need big sticks because I brought a portable electric bear fence to protect us overnight. As you get closer, you can hear it beep—yep, it’s working.

The tide’s risen so much that the boulders we saw earlier are already submerged. You hungry? Let’s check our snacks. We’ve got trail mix, gummy candy, figs, dates, cheese, and crackers. Perfect. With camp set up and food in us, the next priority is fresh water.

There—the bear fence is on, so our food is safe from wolves and bears. Look at this seashell—we need to find a whole one for Mommy; she loves shells. And here’s a clear piece of quartz—beautiful.

This spot looks like an old commercial clam-digging camp. Workers would stay here in summer, store clams in that refrigerated container, and ship them to processing plants. Not sure if the site’s still active, though.

Finally, we found fresh water. What do you think of this bridge, Jake?
