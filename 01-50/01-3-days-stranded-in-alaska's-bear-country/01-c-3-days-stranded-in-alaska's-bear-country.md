You hungry? Want some lunch?

Alright, just a little. I think Jacob’s cold and wet—it’s hard to get him into the tent. Grab your blanket, and when you’re done with your mac and cheese, just leave the bowl outside so it doesn’t spill.
You like it? Good.

I’m going to have a very Alaskan delicacy—hot Tang. It’s nostalgic and perfect for a campout.

Now that we’re fed, we’re still wet and cold, so I think I’ll hunker down in the tent with Jake for a while. Hey Jake, want to watch a movie?
“Red Alert: All Units?”
Alright. Want some cheese and crackers too?

We’ve been watching shows and eating snacks, but I think it’s time to go outside and clean some clams. I’ll pick out the crushed ones, clean them, and eat those tonight.

Here’s what a clam looks like out of its shell. This is the foot—it helps the clam dig. It’s also the tastiest part. Here’s the siphon, which has two tubes; it sucks in water, filters food, and pushes the rest out. The skirt seals the shell shut, and the guts are inside. To clean the siphon, just cut off the dark tip, run a knife down both tubes, and rinse out the silt.

Alright, keeping them warm and clean by the fire.
Hey Jake, welcome out. Sit here next to the knife. Nice not to be rained on anymore. Want some clams?
Alright, here you go. Salt, pepper, and pancake mix—that’s all it takes. Delicious, right?

Clams are great, but they can be rubbery if overcooked. The key is to cook them quickly—seconds, not minutes.

Now I need to refill the water before it gets too late.

Hey Jake, want to see me shoot the gun?
Think I can hit that shell?
Yes! What do you think—cool?

This is a seven-millimeter Magnum. It kicks like a mule. My dad gave me this rifle when I was a teenager. I haven’t used it in twenty years, but I hope to go hunting with it this fall.

Alright Jake, let’s roast some marshmallows. Is that one yours? If not, I’ll eat it. Lava rock chocolate—oh, that’s gooey. Let me try a little of your marshmallow; I need it to fix my broken selfie-stick tripod. Believe it or not, it actually works. Thanks, Jake.

Now, would you like to sit by the fire with your blanket? You’re getting so big. Snuggle in and sleep while I tidy up camp.

Jacob’s asleep, and I’ve got a few quiet hours before bed. Just sitting here by the fire. It’s been an absolutely beautiful spot—really enjoyed it. If all goes well, today will be our last day here. I’ll break down the bear fence; I don’t need it while I’m awake.

Jacob’s jacket is damp, so we’ll hang it up to dry. I’m glad the weather is clear—it’s miserable packing in the rain.

This might sound strange, but fried Spam with instant oatmeal actually tastes great together. Let’s see if Jacob wants some breakfast.
Hey Jacob, I’ve got breakfast for you!

Out there on the mudflats, a boat just ran aground—it’s a clam fishing charter. These boats come when the tide is falling, run aground, and passengers dig clams. When the tide comes back in, the boat floats again, and they leave.

Alright, time to walk back to our rendezvous point.

Hey Thomas, did you guys have fun? Did you enjoy the flight?
